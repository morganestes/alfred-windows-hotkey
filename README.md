Windows Hotkey Workflow for Alfred 2
=====================

Workflow for Alfred 2 to use Windows key combos to perform system functions.

---

I use the Microsoft Natural series of keyboards on all my computers, and frequently switch between Windows and OS X. I have it mapped so the keys are in the same places as the Mac keyboard (meaning Ctrl == control, Win == option, Alt == command) since that's the OS I use most often.

This workflow lets me use the Win+key combo to perform the most common system functions I use regularly:

* Win + L: Lock screen
* Win + U: Shut Down
* Win + R: Restart
* Shift + Alt + F4: Quit all
* Ctrl + Shift + Esc: Application Monitor

The same keys work on the Mac keyboard, just with different names on the keys:

* ⌥ + L: Lock screen
* ⌥ + U: Shut Down
* ⌥ + R: Restart
* ⇧ + ⌘ + F4: Quit all
* ˄ + ⇧ + ⎋ (␛): Application Monitor
